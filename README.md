# Enemy Expansion

A mod that aims to make combat encounters in Minecraft more varied and interesting with the introduction of several new
mobs. The mod is in continual development, consistently being updated by Nekomaster with all manner of creatures to
freshen up your combat experience.

I highly suggest installing In Control! or Bad Mobs to disable or limit the spawning of mobs you don't like. You could
also use Mobs Properties Randomness if you wanted to weaken or buff certain mobs too!
Whilst all the mobs can be dealt with using only vanilla mechanics, it'd be far more fun if you also installed other
mods that implemented more complex battle mechanics too, including Combat Roll and Shield Expansion.

## Mobs

### Sprinter

A Zombie that runs fast! When attacked, becomes stunned for a moment before resuming its assault.

### Slugger

A Zombie that hits hard! When attacked, briefly gains a speed boost to rush you down with. Back-peddle for your life!

### Meature

Little undead guy doesn't burn in sunlight, and who loves flesh so much, will cannibalise it's fellow Zombie if no
humans are nearby!

Can be tamed with Rotten Flesh, and will gain more and more health on each kill it earns.

Rarely drops the Meathead, a helmet that gives the player temporary Strength for each kill they earn.

### Vampire

The dreadful bloodsucker of the underground, Vampires are exceedingly dangerous due to their versatility. Upon biting a
victim, they regenerate some of their health and have inflict both momentary Blindness, and the new Bitten effect, which
will burn whoever has it under daylight - And if the bite victim is a mob... They're doomed to become a Vampire too,
just like their aggressor. (They will target Zombies when ground-based, even if a player is nearby, specifically to
create reinforcements!) They also inflict blindness, before running away. If hurt enough, they may chose to engage in
flight mode, in which they'll rush you down when they're not floating about idly. In moments of desperation, they may
turn into the Biter, a smaller, more erratic version of themselves. If they do this and return to normal, they'll have
regenerated all their health. Take them out whilst they're small to avoid that! If they get burnt, they'll quickly
combust and explode. Rarely drops the Headbiter, a helmet that gives the player temporary Regeneration for each kill
they earn.
